{"name":"Want to be our CTO?","tagline":"Lead the revolution","body":"### Come lead the revolution\r\n\r\n“We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.” Tyler Winklevoss, Entrepreneur\r\n\r\nWe love Bitcoin, and crypto-currencies in general. Our mission is to make them easy and simple ... usable by your mom and dad.\r\n\r\nOur key project is [YourBitBot](http://yourbitbot.com), a service that let newcomers easily diversify their investment, although we have some other interesting stuff cooking as well.\r\n\r\n### What we need\r\nA CTO. Someone to take ownership of our entire technical operation, architecture, and security. We already have tons of knowledge about Bitcoin in the company, so you are not required to come with \"The Bitcoin Craze\" already in you ... you will learn the ropes very quickly.\r\n\r\nYou will build our entire technological operation from day one, will be in charge of customer funds, our reputation, our growth. In time you will recruit and possibly manage our R&D team.\r\n\r\nYou will become passionate about Bitcoin ... we all are, and we believe you can't effectively work on something you're not passionate about (we'll be happy to share with you why we're passionate about Bitcoin).\r\n\r\n### We are super early stage\r\nWe have not raised any funds yet, and are instead focusing on building a strong team of co-founders, doing market validation, and testing the complicated regulatory aspects involved. You should be willing to dedicate large portions of your time, without receiving any salary, for at least 3-6 months.\r\n\r\n### We are (extremely) open and transparent\r\nAsk us anything about our business, and we'll happily share with you. You should be ready to challenge common myths about building startups such as \"secrecy is essential to build a successful company\".\r\n\r\n### Who we are\r\n\r\n1.
