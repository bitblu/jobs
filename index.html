<a name="come-lead-the-revolution" class="anchor" href="#come-lead-the-revolution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Currently, Bitcoin is like the Internet before the browser</h3>

<p>"We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error." -- Tyler Winklevoss, Entrepreneur</p>

<p>"Crypto currencies are one of those tidal waves that change a complete industry.

With banks and other legacy financial institutions at best not really getting it, and at worst trying to work against it, there comes a need for a new form of portfolio management. I can't wait to see the first deployments of Bitblu and how this great team tackles this problem." -- Eden Shochat, aleph.vc, the Israeli Bitcoin Foundation.
</p>

<p>We love Bitcoin, and crypto-currencies in general. Our mission is to build a world-class investment platform that specializes in digital currencies, because the world will soon need such a platform.</p>

<p>You can learn more about us on <a href='http://bitblu.com/'>our website</a> and <a href='http://blog.bitblu.com/2013/08/23/what-is-bitblu/'>blog</a></p>

<h3>
<a name="what-we-need" class="anchor" href="#what-we-need"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What we need</h3>

<p>A CTO. Someone to take ownership of our entire technical operation, architecture, and security. 
You have to be top notch. You could get a job at Google or Facebook it you wanted too ... but you just love startups too damn much and are looking for the challenge of building a new company from scratch.</p>

<p>You <a href='http://marcbarros.com/life-is-too-short-to-work-with-assholes'>can't be an asshole</a>. We are going to have fun building our company, so please, if you can't play well with others, do not approach us.</p>

<p>We already have tons of knowledge about Bitcoin in the company, so you are not required to come with "The Bitcoin Craze" already in you ... you will learn the ropes very quickly.</p>

<p>You will build our entire technological stack from day one. You will build a secure and scalable system tha holds customers' funds, while also building our web front and and mobile app (you will be able to hire people to help you accomplish all this).</p>

<p>You will become passionate about Bitcoin ... we all are, and we believe you can't effectively work on something you're not passionate about (we'll be happy to share with you why we're passionate about Bitcoin).</p>

<h3>
<a name="we-are-super-early-stage" class="anchor" href="#we-are-super-early-stage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are an early stage startup</h3>

<p>We have are gearign towards a pre-seed round, but have not raised any funds at this point. You will work for equity, and will receive the same equity as the other co-founders. You should be willing to commit 100% of your time, without receiving any salary, for at least 3-6 months.</p>

<h3>
<a name="we-are-extremely-open-and-transparent" class="anchor" href="#we-are-extremely-open-and-transparent"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are (extremely) open and transparent</h3>

<p>Ask us anything about our business, and we'll happily share with you. You should be ready to challenge common myths about building startups such as "secrecy is essential to build a successful company".</p>

<h3>We are based in Israel, but recruiting globally</h3>
We are open to candidates from all locations. Currently our small team of co-founders is located in Israel, but are studying the <a href='https://www.quora.com/Distributed-Startups/What-are-some-examples-of-distributed-startups-and-companies'>distributed company structure</a> used by companies such as Github and <a href='http://teamtreehouse.com/'>Treehouse,</a>. If you're good enough, you won't have to relocate to Israel to work with us, and will be able to recruit your own team, either in your own area or globally.

<h3>Press</h3>
You can see this (Hebrew) <a href='http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000877287'>article that mentions us</a> on Globes, one of the leading Israeli business magazines.
