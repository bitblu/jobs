<a name="come-lead-the-revolution" class="anchor" href="#come-lead-the-revolution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Currently, Bitcoin is like the Internet before the browser</h3>

<p>“We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.” Tyler Winklevoss, Entrepreneur</p>

<p>We love Bitcoin, and crypto-currencies in general. Our mission is to make them easy and simple ... usable by your mom and dad.</p>

<p>Our key project is <a href="http://yourbitbot.com">YourBitBot</a>, a service that lets newcomers easily diversify their investment, although we have some other interesting stuff cooking as well.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-we-need" class="anchor" href="#what-we-need"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What we need</h3>

<p>A CTO. Someone to take ownership of our entire technical operation, architecture, and security. We already have tons of knowledge about Bitcoin in the company, so you are not required to come with "The Bitcoin Craze" already in you ... you will learn the ropes very quickly.</p>

<p>You will build our entire technological stasck from day one. You will build a secure and scalable system tha holds customers' funds. In time you will recruit and possibly manage our R&amp;D team.</p>

<p>You will become passionate about Bitcoin ... we all are, and we believe you can't effectively work on something you're not passionate about (we'll be happy to share with you why we're passionate about Bitcoin).</p>

<h3>
<a name="we-are-super-early-stage" class="anchor" href="#we-are-super-early-stage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are super early stage</h3>

<p>We have not raised any funds yet, and are instead focusing on building a strong team, doing market validation, and researching the complicated regulatory aspects involved. You should be willing to dedicate large portions of your time, without receiving any salary, for at least 3-6 months.</p>

<h3>
<a name="we-are-extremely-open-and-transparent" class="anchor" href="#we-are-extremely-open-and-transparent"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We are (extremely) open and transparent</h3>

<p>Ask us anything about our business, and we'll happily share with you. You should be ready to challenge common myths about building startups such as "secrecy is essential to build a successful company".</p>
